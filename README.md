- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @adamzvolanek
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in expanding my technical knowledge with increasing the use of Python for any development efforts and further integrating best DevOps practices on my at home server. Currently, I lean more towards the 'Ops' comapred to the Dev as I work on my server. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in Python in conjunction with my schooling, AWS Cloud concepts (Solutions Architect Associate Cert.), and continuing to learn and build my at home server with more automation tooling.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me... still figuring this one out.
