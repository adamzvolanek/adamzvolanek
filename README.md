- 👋 Hi, I’m @adamzvolanek
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my programming knowledge with transitioning from Matlab to Python, and further integrating best DevOps practices on my at home server. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in Python in conjunction with my schooling, AWS Cloud concepts (Solutions Architect Associate Cert.), and continuing to learn and build my at home server with more automation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automating Unraid Docker Containers with Ansible Playbooks.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
