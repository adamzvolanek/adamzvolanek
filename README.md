- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @adamzvolanek
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in expanding my technical knowledge to further integrating best DevOps practices to my home lab. Currently, my preference is towards the 'Ops' side comapred to the Dev, but personal preferences change.
- ðŸŒ± I have changed full-time jobs, however continuing to apply best DevOps practices in my home lab. I have earned the AWS Cloud Practioner certifiaction and maintain a CompTIA Sec+ certification.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me... still figuring this one out.
